## File [portScanner.java](https://github.com/vg-shamking/Pentest/blob/main/portScanner.java) and file [scanner.py](https://github.com/vg-shamking/Pentest/blob/main/scanner.py):

	> Same function - to see open ports;
	> Written by me in java and python to see the difference;
	> My first language is java - I just want to break the rumors of "pro"grammers that java is not pentest language: 
		all depends on knowledge - shitty not languages - people who don't try to get out of their mind barriers.
